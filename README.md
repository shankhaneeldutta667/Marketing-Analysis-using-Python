### Agenda

- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing.
- Machine Learning; Model Building and Evaluation.

### Domain: Marketing

### Problem Statement:
  You're a marketing analyst and you've been told by the Senior Marketing Manager that recent marketing campaigns have not been as effective as they were expected to be. You need to 
  analyze the data set in order to understand this problem and propose data-driven solutions. You are required to solve the following questions to generate a report for your management.

### EDA
Exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many insights from it. EDA is all about making sense of data
### Data Preprocessing
Data Preprocessing focuses on processing the data and making it suitable for the model.
Before building any machine learning model it is crucial to perform data preprocessing to feed the correct data to the model to learn and predict. Model performance depends on the quality of data needed for the model to train.

It involves various steps like
- Handling duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Handling outliers
- Handling garbage data, incorrect or invalid data
- Changing data types
- Converting features into numerical data type
- Standardizing and normalizing the data
- Making transformations of variables as needed - log transformation, power transformation, etc
- These are some of the common steps. But most of these data preprocessing steps depend on case to case basis.
